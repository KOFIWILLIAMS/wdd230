                    The purpose of a good site layout is to provide a safe and
                    economical flow of materials and people around a plant which
                    is socially acceptable to workers and neighbors to produce a
                    specified product reliably and cost-effectively.
                    Site access, utility locations, soil conditions, safety and
                    health considerations, temporary services, and the list goes
                    on. Not only is there a huge list of factors that go into
                    this process, but it's not uncommon for a site to change as
                    development occurs.
                    The site layout turns up to be an important parameter when
                    it comes to project scheduling and execution. As the site
                    layout is directly related to the actual site area
                    availability and utilization of that area so that the
                    project is carried out in smooth flow.
                    Layout problems are found in several types of manufacturing
                    systems. Typically, layout problems are related to the
                    location of facilities (e.g., machines, departments) in a
                    plant. They are known to greatly impact the system
                    performance. Most of these problems are NP hard.
                    I therefore strongly believe that our site plan layout is
                    going to be absence of any hazards.
