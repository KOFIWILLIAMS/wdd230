            <p>
                A full-stack developer is a developer or engineer who can build both the front end and the back end of a
                website. The front end (the parts of a website a user sees and interacts with) and the back end (the
                behind-the-scenes data storage and processing) require different skill sets. Since full-stack developers
                are involved with all aspects of the development process, they must have expertise in both.

                A full-stack developer can work in-house or at a computer development company that engineers websites,
                software, and other components for other businesses.

            You can master all the techniques involved in a development project
            You can make a prototype very rapidly
            You can provide help to all the team members
            You can reduce the cost of the project
            You can reduce the time used for team communication
            You can switch between front and back end development based on requirements
            You can better understand all aspects of new and upcoming technologies

            <h4>Some of the Disadvantages</h4>

            The solution chosen can be wrong for the project
            The solution chosen can be dependent on developer skills
            The solution can generate a key person risk
            Being a full stack developer is increasingly complex
